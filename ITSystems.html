								<h2>What are factors that affect choice of an IT system?</h2>
								<p>When choosing an IT system, there are many factors to consider. Obviously, the price and the power is important, but so are things like the user’s needs and security.</br>
                   Understanding these factors and balancing them against each other is very important when choosing an IT system.</p>

								<h2>User Experience</h2>
								<p>The “user experience” is about the feeling a person gets when making use of a device. When purchasing an IT system, we all want to use it for different reasons and are looking for a different experience from the device</p>

							<h2>User Needs</h2>
							<p>This is about what actual tasks the user wants to perform using the IT system. We all use IT systems for different reasons, and often we have multiple devices and we use each for a separate reason</p>

							<h2>Compatibility</h2>
							<p>This is about whether the IT system can communicate with the other devices you are using it with. Peripheral devices, for example, will need to be able to connect to and work with the IT system</p>

								<h2>Efficiency</h2>
								<p>This is about how effectively tasks can be completed by the digital device with as little wastage of resources as possible. The resources we most often consider are time and staff. Can the system perform the task quicker? Does it need fewer people to operate it? However, it can also be energy efficiency, such as a technology that requires less power to run</p>

							<h2>Implementation</h2>
							<p>This is about the time involved with putting a new system into effect. This isn’t just the time for delivering the hardware, connecting it up and running it, because we also need to install our software and likely transfer data from the old system to the new one</p>

								<h2>Productivity</h2>
								<p>This is about how quickly tasks can be completed when making use of an IT system. Slow boot times, save/load times & whether the device tends to freeze or crash can have a big impact on efficiency</p>
